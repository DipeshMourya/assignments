1.What is JavaScript?
 JavaScript is a scripting language. It is different from Java language. It is object-based, lightweight, cross-platform translated language. 
 It is widely used for client-side validation. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the 
 JavaScript code for the web browser.

2.What is the use of isNaN function?
 The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number. Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be 
 surprising, you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN() .

3.What is negative Infinity?.
 Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing the negative number by zero. 
 
4.Which company developed JavaScript?
 JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for 
 use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.

5.What are undeclared and undefined variables?
 Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while undefined variables are those that have 
 been declared but not given a value. Understanding the difference between these two terms is crucial for writing correct and effective 
 JavaScript code.

6.Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
 With document.createElement() method you can create a specified HTML element dynamically in JavaScript. Once created, you can insert (or add) 
 the element to your web page, or add it to a pre-defined element or a dynamically created element. In fact, you can create an entire form 
 dynamically using this method.
 code for adding new elements dynamically:
      
     var div=document.createElement("div")

 were,div is an one of the element.    

7.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
 "View state" is specific to a page in a session whereas "Session state" is specific to a user or browser that can be accessed across all pages 
 in the web application.

8.What is === operator?
 The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the 
 strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

9.How can the style/class of an element be changed?
 To change the styles/class of all elements : 
  Use the querySelectorAll() method to get a collection of the elements with the specific class.
  Use the forEach() method to iterate over the collection.
  On each iteration, use the style object to change the element's styles.

10.How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
 There are two ways to do it:
  1. Using JavaScript extensions (runs from JavaScript Editor)
     In JavaScript Extensions, you can use
     fh = fopen(getScriptPath(), 0); to open a file
  
  2. Using a web page and ActiveX objects (Internet Explorer only)
     Using ActiveX objects, following should be included in your code to read a file:
     var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
     var s = fso.OpenTextFile("C:\\example.txt", 1, true);

11.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
 There are four types of loops in JavaScript:
  for loop
  while loop
  do-while loop
  for-in loop

  JavaScript For loop:
    The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known.

  JavaScript While loop:
    The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known.   
 
  JavaScript Do-while loop:
    The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once 
    whether condition is true or false. 

  JavaScript For-in loop:
    The JavaScript for in loop is used to iterate the properties of an object.

12.How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
 To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function returns 
 Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number. If a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the 
 output. This function won't accept spaces. 

13.What is the function of the delete operator?
 The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object,
 the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.
 
14.What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
 In Javascript, popup boxes are used to display the message or notification to the user. There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript
 namely Alert Box, Confirm Box and Prompt Box.
  Alert Box:
    It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert box is displayed to the user, the user needs to press ok and 
    proceed.

  Confirm Box:
    It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or permission from the user. The user has to press the ok or cancel button
    to proceed.  

  Prompt Box:
    It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further use. After entering the required details user have to click 
    ok to proceed next stage else by pressing the cancel button user returns the null value. 

15.What is the use of Void (0)?
 “javascript: void(0)” is similar to void. javascript: void(0) means return undefined as a primitive value. We use this to prevent any
 negative effects on a webpage when we insert some expression. For example, in the case of URL hyperlinks.

16.How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
 In JavaScript, we can use window. location object to force a page to load another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of
 a new page.

17.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
 Disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript are as follows:
  The use of innerHTML very slow
  Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements
  Content is replaced everywhere
  Appending to innerHTML is not supported
  Old content replaced issue
  Can break the document
  Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS)
